- all standard tests are passing
- messed up the list of parameters of methods (e.g. `int m(, int a, int b){}` allowed) (-1 point)
- Problem with `new int[2][1]` vs. `(new int[2])[1]`
- Missed cases for assignment (e.g. `new A() = 5;` and `new int[4] = 32;`)
- unnecessary check (method-receiver is number?)
- very nice error messages
- nice README file
- "The main difference between 'optional' lists and 'Kleene star' lists lies in the fact that optional lists are parsed just one time, no matter they are empty or contain something."???
